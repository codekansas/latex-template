\section{Background}

This section provides the necessary background information and theoretical foundations for the work presented in this paper. Understanding the fundamental concepts and context is crucial for appreciating the contributions and significance of our research.

\subsection{Problem Domain}

The problem domain encompasses a wide range of challenges that have been extensively studied in the literature. Key aspects include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fundamental principles and theoretical frameworks
    \item Historical development and evolution of the field
    \item Current state-of-the-art approaches and their limitations
    \item Emerging trends and future directions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Concepts}

Several key concepts form the foundation of our work:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Concept A}: This represents the primary theoretical framework that guides our approach. It provides a structured way to understand and analyze the problem space.

    \item \textbf{Concept B}: This concept builds upon Concept A and introduces additional complexity and nuance to the theoretical foundation.

    \item \textbf{Concept C}: This final concept ties together the previous concepts and provides the practical framework for implementation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mathematical Foundations}

The mathematical foundations of our approach can be expressed through several key equations. Let $x$ represent the input variable and $y$ represent the output variable. The relationship between them can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
y = f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot g_i(x)
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ are the weights and $g_i(x)$ are the basis functions.
